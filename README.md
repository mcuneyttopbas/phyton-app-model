# phyton-app-update-concept

A test study on modeling an updatable and multi-window Pyhton application.
This work helps to understand modelling of updatable Phyton app with multi-window desktop application. 
Please be aware in this project, mostly focused on the features of the application rather than its functions. 
Please ignore the aimlessness of the application and the design of the interface.
In order to set an example, error management has been made at some points. However, it was not taken into account in the entire program for the purpose of saving time.
In order for users to see the changes made by other users instantly, requests are sent to the database at regular intervals. For this, MongoDB's Change Streams will be more functional.
